    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sliders for Parameters:\n",
    "    - `prevalence_slider`: Controls the prevalence of the disease in the population (ranging from 0.0001 to 0.1, i.e., 0.01% to 10%).\n",
    "    - `true_positive_slider`: Controls the true positive rate (the accuracy of the test when the person has the disease, ranging from 50% to 100%).\n",
    "    `false_positive_slider`: Controls the false positive rate (the probability that a person without the disease tests positive, ranging from 0% to 10%).\n",
    "2. Bayes' Rule Calculation:\n",
    "    - The function `calculate_bayes` computes the posterior probability using Bayes' Rule based on the values provided by the sliders.\n",
    "    - The function returns the computed posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test.\n",
    "3. Interactive Plot:\n",
    "    - `interactive()` from `ipywidgets` is used to make the widgets interactive. When the user adjusts any slider, the output will automatically update the calculation and show the new posterior probability.\n",
    "4. Display:\n",
    "    - `display(interactive_plot)` makes the interactive widgets visible in the notebook, allowing students to adjust values dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How To Use It:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to adjust the values of:\n",
    "- Prevalence to see how the overall disease rate affects the result.\n",
    "- True Positive Rate to understand how the accuracy of the test affects the posterior probability.\n",
    "- False Positive Rate to see the impact of false positives (incorrectly identifying a healthy person as positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, increasing the false positive rate will typically decrease the posterior probability that someone actually has the disease, even if they tested positive."
